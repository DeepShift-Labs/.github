Welcome to DeepShift Labs! We are excited you are here! At DeepShift Labs, we reach for goals humanity has ever dreamed of. 
We are making an AI unparallel to any other AI in existence. It is called M.A.G.I.S.T. and will be able to think like a human! We plan on embedding this into a biomimetic robot dog! This research will push humanity into a new generation of robotic intelligence.
